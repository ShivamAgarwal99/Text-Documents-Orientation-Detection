# Text-Documents Orientation Detection
• Build a model aiming to solve the real-world problem of Text-Document Orientation Detection using convolutional neural networks.

• Designed model achieves accuracy of 97.95% using 5 layer CNN architecture trained over 9000 and tested over 1500 images dataset.

• Researched over model interpretability via two algorithms 1) Observe intermediate visualization of input image after every CNN layer and 2) By observing CNN fixations over input image.
